	  <p class="text">We kick off our design process with an on-site visit to hear all of your goals for your space. From your hall bathroom wishes, to your kitchen remodel dreams, we listen and cast our vision. This is the part where you tells us all of our goals for your space (large or small),  express pain points you’d like for us to  focus on, and we will form them into design phases & get started on your project. Note; This is not a simple meeting, we get to work and start measuring your space to see the “as built” layout  so that we can see what we are working with and get a plan in place. </p>

	  <p class ="text">After hearing your design goals, we sit down as a team and map out our thoughts for your space. From finishes to large furniture decisions, we map everything out and give you a game plan with renderings to show you what your new space will look, feel and flow like.  After you approve, we order your selections, fixtures and decor we sourced & start prepping for install day!</p>
